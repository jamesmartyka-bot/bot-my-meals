-- Meal history: title-only nights for finished weeks.
-- A week is finished when it is locked AND its Saturday is in the past
-- in the household timezone (the next calendar day has started).
-- Unlocked weeks are not archived. The live This week row is unchanged.
-- Stored per night: week start, night date, meal title, plates.
-- No recipe body, ingredients, steps, images, or shopping lines.
